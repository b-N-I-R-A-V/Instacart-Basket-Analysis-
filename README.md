# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project
Welcome to my project where I explore the fascinating world of data analysis using Python and Tableau. In this project, we are analyzing Instacart's Grocery Basket who wants to uncover more information about their sales pattern. The instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with theri purchasing behaviours. Of course, one size does not fit all when it comes to marketing strategies. Therefore, our primary focus is to dissect customer diversity and purchasing behaviors to devise targeted marketing campaigns.

## Key Questions

In this project, I aim to answer the following key questions:

1. What are the busiest days and hours for order placement?
2. How does the time of day influence customer spending behavior?
3. Can we simplify product price range groupings for targeted marketing?
4. Which product categories are most popular among Instacart customers?
5. What is the distribution of brand loyalty among users?
6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on customer loyalty status?
7. How do ordering habits vary across different regions?
8. Is there a relationship between age, family status, and ordering behavior?
9. What demographic classifications emerge from the data?
10. How do different customer profiles differ in terms of order price, frequency, and product preferences?

## Tools and Libraries

For this analysis, I utilize Python as my primary programming language and Tableau for data visualization. Leveraging the power of Python, I employ various libraries including:
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization

## Datasets 
We have used open-source data sets from Instacart. You can find the link [here.](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b)


By harnessing the capabilities of these tools and libraries, I aim to extract valuable insights from the data and present them in a clear and compelling manner. Join me on this journey as we unravel the mysteries hidden within the data and pave the way for informed decision-making.
